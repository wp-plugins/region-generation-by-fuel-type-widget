Australian Live Generation by Fuel Type widget by Global-Roam.

== Description ==

We are pleased to be able to work with the RenewEconomy team to help people understand how much renewable 
generation is currently contributing to electricity supplies in the NEM.

It shows, for each region of Australiaâ€™s National Electricity Market (NEM), how much electricity is being 
generated by each fuel type, using data published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the 
Australian Photovoltaic Institute (APVI).

The widget also shows data for the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in Western Australia using data 
published by the Independent Market Operator (IMO-WA).
