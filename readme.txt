Region Generation by Fuel Type widget by Global-Roam.

== Description ==

We are pleased to be able to work with the RenewEconomy team to assist RenewEconomy readers 
to understand how much renewable generation is currently contributing to electricity supplies in the NEM.

It shows, for each region of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), how much electricity is being 
generated by each fuel type, using data published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the 
Australian Photovoltaic Institute (APVI).
